# NovaBot

This is a temporary read me, and if you have trouble running the bot feel free to contact me.

To used this bot:
First run `npm install` or `yarn install` whichever you prefer.
you will need to compile the typescript, to do so type `tsc main.ts`

create the file data/info.json, and inside of it include:
{
    "key": "your discord key",
    "prefix": "!"
}
The key is the discord key for your bot, and the prefix is the command identifier, to say it a different way, the prefix is the character that goes before commands that the bot recoginizes.

Type `node main` in your terminal to start the bot.

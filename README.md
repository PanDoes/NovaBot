# NovaBot

This is a temporary read me, and if you have trouble running the bot feel free to contact me.

To used this bot:
You must have node installed, and include the package discord.js.
Then create a info.json file, and in it include this:
{
    "key": "your discord key",
    "prefix": "!"
}
The key is the discord key for your bot, and the prefix is the command identifier, to say it a different way, the prefix is the character that goes before commands that the bot recoginizes.

Type `node main` in your terminal to start the bot.
